For these three challenges, I am using Visual Studio to code the Gold Badge Challenge from Eleven Fifty Academy, the three prompts I chose are the, Challenge One: Cafe, Challenge Two: Komodo Claims, and Challenge Three: Komodo Badges. I used dictionary and queue as my data structures, I used queue in Challenge Two and dictionary in Challenge Three. Each of these challenges have been unit tested for there repository methods Add,Delete,Read, and etc. Challenge One requires you to build a cafe menu that create's,delete's, and read's a list of items on the cafe's menu. Challenge Two requires you to make Komodo Insurance a app to keep track of their claims, on this app menu we will be able to see all claims, take care of all claims, and enter new ones. Challenge Three requires you to make an app to maintain a dictionary of employee badge information. This badge information will allow the agents to have access to the doors they were assigned. The most difficult issues I have had with this project was the Unit Testing and understanding List, Dictionary, and Queue, as well as memorizing all of this information at once while building my project as well as learning something new throughout each of my projects.
